## üëã Hey, this is us
<img width="900" alt="specstory2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5263ce23-d733-4050-bb16-8930b9f7a013" />


- At [SpecStory](www.specstory.com) we think the future of software creation is more powerful and accessible _when AI enhances human creativity_.
- AI is already effective at handling implementation details: human focus on intent and impact has never been more important.

We're building tools to help [vibecoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), [software composers](https://tolacapital.com/2024/11/13/the-rise-of-the-software-composer-a-new-era-of-software-creation) and AI-first builders **save, search, share and ship with intent.**

### ü§ñ Products

Our first product is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes it easy to **save, search and share your AI chat history.** 
- It exports your AI chats in searchable structured Markdown that you can version.
- Never lose a great solution, easily share interactions, and use conversation history to refine custom instructions and project rules.

We support [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as of release `v0.11.0` [(changelog)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog).

- For Cursor: It is tested to work for `Version: 0.43.6` and later
- For Copilot: It is tested to work for `Version: 1.300.0` and later

You can view us on [VS Code Marketplace here](http://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) 

> [!TIP]
**Install the lastest version VSIX directly from our [documentation site](docs.specstory.com), or from the Extensions side bar in Copilot or Cursor by searching for SpecStory.** 

It enables users to:

- Automatically save all AI coding interactions in human and LLM readable Markdown in a special `.specstory/history` directory in your project.
- Cherry pick exactly what you want to save into a single previewable file. 
- Share these coding interactions anonymously on the web with others.
- Derive Rules for AI automatically to align your preferences
