At [Specstory](https://specstory.com/), we believe the future of software creation is more powerful and accessible _when AI enhances human creativity_. 

AI is already effective at handling implementation details: human focus on intent and impact has never been more important.

We're building tools to help [software composers](https://tolacapital.com/2024/11/13/the-rise-of-the-software-composer-a-new-era-of-software-creation) and AI-first builders _capture, search and learn from every AI coding journey_ using CHOP (Chat Oriented Programming). 

### ü§ñ Product

Our first product is a Visual Studio Code extension for [Cursor](https://cursor.com/): the AI Code Editor. You can view us on [VS Code Marketplace here](http://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) 

> [!TIP]
**Install the lastest version VSIX directly from our [documentation site](docs.specstory.com), or from the Extensions side bar in VS Code by searching for SpecStory.** 

It enables users to:

- Automatically save all AI coding interactions in human and LLM readable Markdown in a special `.specstory/history` directory in your project
- Cherry pick exactly what you want to save into a single previewable file 
- Share these coding interactions anonymously on the web with others
