## üí° What we think

At [SpecStory](https://specstory.com/) we think the future of software creation is more powerful and accessible _when AI enhances human creativity_.

- AI is already effective at handling implementation details: human focus on intent and impact has never been more important.
- We're building to help [vibecoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), [software composers](https://tolacapital.com/2024/11/13/the-rise-of-the-software-composer-a-new-era-of-software-creation) and AI-first builders **save, search, share and ship with intent.**

### ü§ñ Products

We're building a suite of tools to enhance your AI development workflow‚Äîfrom capturing conversations to crafting specifications.

### üëã Hey, this is us

In late 2024, [Jake](https://github.com/jakelevirne), [Sean](https://github.com/belucid) and [Greg](https://github.com/gregce) teamed up to solve a critical gap emerging in AI coding: preserving human intent. As software creation becomes more agentic, **intent is the new source code.**
